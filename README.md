You are required to implement a system to find the nmost popular hashtags thatappear on social media suchas Facebook or Twitter. For the scope of this project hashtags will be given from aninput file.Basic idea for the implementation is to use a max priority structure to find out  the most popular hashtags.You must use the following structures for the implementation.1. Max Fibonacci heap: use to keep track of the frequencies of hashtags.2.  Hash table: The key for the hashtable is the hashtag,and the value is the pointer to the corresponding node in the Fibonacci heap.You can assume there will be a large number of hashtags appearingin the stream and you need to perform increase key operation many times. Max Fibonacciheap is recommended because it has an amortized complexity of O(1) fortheincrease key operation.You should implement all Fibonacci heap functions discussed  in  class.  For  the  hash  table,  you  can  use  an  implementation  from  any  library  that  your programming languages supports (e.g., STL).
